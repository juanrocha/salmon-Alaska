```{r}
library(tidyverse)

dat <- readr::read_tsv(file = "data/Alaska_salmon/salmon_cluster_2021.txt")
dat

```

The unit of analysis are fishing trips (coded by date), per household. Each household 
has a permit (`permitno`) with a harvest limit (`harvestlimit`) that depend on 
household size (`householdsize`). 

The file has all fishing trips of the 2021 season, from `r `dat |> pull(date) |> range()`.
So `year` is constant and can be dropped.

```{r}
